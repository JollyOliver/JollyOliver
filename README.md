- Hello, I’m @JollyOliver! I'm 20 y/o and currently learning programing with different kinds of languages.
- I’m interested in any sort of projects as long as I get a chance to learn and expand on what I'm already currently learning.
- I’m currently learning Python, Java, HTML, CSS, also planning to take a shot at C# (again) sometime soon.
- I’m not looking to collaborate right now as I do have to balance my studies with my current work and other day to day compromises, but hope to be able to collaborate soon.
- Reach me through my personal e-mail and I'll get back to you as soon as I can: juliaoliver1811@outlook.com
